            What is Composition?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Just the same as how a songwriter must compose a song, a photographer must compose an image. There are many techniques 
            to create an image that is pleasing to the eye, and some are very simple to learn; you may already be familiar
            with some of them.

                    A <b>vanishing point</b> is a concept in visual art that dates back to the Renaissance period. In photographry, 
                    strong vanishing lines point the viewers eyes towards the subject or the center of the image. This sample picture 
                    uses the edges of the road and the yellow center line to point your vision right to the middle of the frame, and then 
                    to the mountains in the background.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="tabs-2">
                <p>
                    <a href="../Pictures/Vanishing-balance.JPG" title="Balance" class="popup_image">
                        <img src="../Pictures/Vanishing-balance.JPG">
                    </a>
                    <b>Balance</b> in the context of a picture means that there is an equal amount to look at on both sides. Symmetry is 
                    a good way to start balancing your pictures. In this picture, the center line of the road follows right along the middle 
                    of the image, and the horizon is right at the middle on the vertical axis.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div id="tabs-3">

                <a href="../Pictures/Vanishing-thirds.JPG" title="The Rule of Thirds" class="popup_image">
                    <img src="../Pictures/Vanishing-thirds.JPG">
                </a>
                A slightly more advanced method to compose your pictures is by using the <b>rule of thirds</b>. If you imagine a tic-tac-toe 
                grid on a picture, aligning important visual elements within the boxes creates a natural ensemble that is generally pleasing 
                to look at. Notice how the bottom third of this picture is filled by the road, while the top third is filled entirely by sky.
