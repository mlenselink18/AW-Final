                Exposing an Image
            </h2>
            <p>
                Exposure is the act of letting light into a camera and capturing the light either on film
                or on a digital sensor. Understanding exposure is the most fundamental aspect of taking a picture.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are three factors that affect your image is exposed: shutter speed, aperture, and ISO. Take a look through the 
                following tabs to learn how each of these impact the final picture. You can click on each image for a larger view.

                    Cameras operate by opening a shutter to let light inside. How long that shutter remains open is known 
                    as the <b>shutter speed</b>. It can be fast or slow depending on your needs.
                </p>

                        <img src="../Pictures/fast_shutter-min.jpg">
                    </a>
                    A fast shutter speed captures action, even if it happens in a fraction of a second. An athlete moves 
                    fast, but with the right technique, a photographer can still catch the goal-winning kick.
                </p>

                    <a href="../Pictures/slow_shutter-min.jpg" title="Slow Shutter" class="popup_image">
                        <img src="../Pictures/slow_shutter-min.jpg">
                    </a>
                    A slow shutter speed leaves the shutter open and lets more light in. This means that actions will look 
                    smoothed-out in the image, such as this waterfall.
                </p>

                    </a>
                    While the shutter is open to let light in, the <b>aperture</b> of the lens closes partially to restrict how much light 
                    passes through and enters the camera. How much the aperture closes is represented by a number known as the 
                    <b>f-stop</b>. A larger number indicates a narrower opening, while smaller numbers mean that it closes less.
                    The image to the left shows a high f-stop.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="../Pictures/aperture_wide-min.jpg" title="Wide Aperture" class="popup_image">
                        <img src="../Pictures/aperture_wide-min.jpg">
                    </a>
                    This image shows a low f-stop number. Besides letting more or less light into 
                    the camera, the f-stop number changes how much of the image is in focus at one time. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="../Pictures/narrow_dof-min.jpg" title="Slim Depth of Field" class="popup_image">
                        <img src="../Pictures/narrow_dof-min.jpg">
                    </a>
                    A smaller f-stop number only allows a very thin slice of the image to be sharp and 
                    in focus. This effect is called having a <b>narrow depth of field</b>. Many photographers use this effect to draw a viewer's 
                    attention to a particular area of the picture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="../Pictures/long_dof-min.jpg" title="Long Depth of Field" class="popup_image">
                        <img src="../Pictures/long_dof-min.jpg">
                    </a>
                    A larger f-stop allows more of the image to stay sharp and in focus. When there isn't 
                    one particular subject in the image, it can be useful to have a <b>long depth of field</b>, such as a sweeping landscape view.

                    To capture an image, a camera either uses <i>film</i> or a <i>digital sensor</i>, both 
                    of which have a reaction on exposure to light. <b>ISO</b> is a number that indicates how quickly that reaction takes place. ISO
                    is an internationally standard number, so any camera or film you ever use will have the same numbers that mean the same thing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="../Pictures/high_iso-min.jpg" title="High ISO" class="popup_image">
                        <img src="../Pictures/high_iso-min.jpg">
                    </a>
                    A high-ISO picture paired with a long shutter opening can even capture images of stars
                    that might otherwise not be visible to the unaided eye.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="../Pictures/low_iso-min.jpg" title="Low ISO" class="popup_image">
                        <img src="../Pictures/low_iso-min.jpg">
                    </a>
                    A lower ISO is typically all you need during the daytime, since the sun provide plenty of
                    ambient light, even in the shade.
