                    There are so many cameras out there, and this site will teach you how they all capture images. All cameras use the same

                    Does it zoom in?

                    <img src="Pictures/camera_with_lens-min.jpg" alt="A lens on a camera">              
                    Some camera lenses can zoom in to make distant objects look closer, while others capture a wide view but distort their 
                    surroundings. The amound of zoom a lens has is based on its <i>focal length</i>, and this site will teach you how to choose 
                    the right length for your pictures.
